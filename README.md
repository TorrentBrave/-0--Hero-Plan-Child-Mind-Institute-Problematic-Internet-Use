This notebook shows:

* a first analysis of the data

* how to cross-validate a model

* that regression models are better than classification models in this competition, and

* how to tune the thresholds for rounding the regression output.

* The notebook uses polars DataFrames. If you are more fluent with pandas than with polars, this is an opportunity to get to know polars, which is often more efficient than pandas.
